          <h2>CSE Department</h2>
            <p>We the Department of Computer Science and Engineering ever since 1984 strive to create an ambience of academic excellence in which new ideas, research and scholarship flourish and from which the leaders and innovators of tomorrow emerge

                Accredited by the National Board of Accrediation for a period of 2 years, the computer science and engineering is one of the most eminent programme in GCT. The four year under graduate programme in Computer Science is intended to train the students in both advanced areas in the core courses and specialized topics in the emerging technology.
                
                It has become the pool for research scholars with  inclusion of M.Phil and PhD courses in 1992. We have a team of highly qualified and dedicated teaching faculty well supported by a  group of Techincal support staff for keeping campus vibrant as a temple of knowledge under a self imposed discipline by one and all.
                
                Our future techies, scientists, executives, entrepreneurs are nurtured and encouraged with creative approach. It has excellent infrastructure and facilities for students. It is the endeavor of the management to periodically migrate to the latest software and hardware to keep pace with ever changing needs with the industries so that our students come out with latest knowledge in both software and hardware
                
                The necessary licensed software and internet facilities are available for all students round the clock. Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, the curriculum stresses on developing analytical stills, communication, problem solving, and teamwork abilities

        <h2>AIML Department</h2>
        <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all about simulating human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. The field involves developing algorithms for a dynamically changing environment. In 1763, Prof. Thomas Bayes developed a framework for reasoning the probability of occurrence of a future event based on the probabilities of prior events; to Prof. John McCarthy, who introduced Artificial intelligence to the world in 1956, AI has seen many implementations and research challenges. The field is in continuous transition to achieve maturity to handle the 21st-century requirements of industries and society.

        According to a Mckinsey report, telecommunication, automotive, and financial services are high-end adopters of AI. Retail industries, Media/entertainment, and CPG, are the middle-level adopters, whereas education, health care, and travel/tourism industries are low-end adopters, as the industries achieve digital maturity, the levels of these adoptions also vary.

        AI & ML empower enterprise-level problem solving with the application of cutting-edge technologies with a true sense of digital transformation, reducing the production/service costs, an increased degree of customer satisfaction with quality outcomes. With an increased budgetary provision for AI & ML technologies R&D, developed and developing countries have targeted achieving AI supremacy in the coming decade. The Govt. of India, in its Budget 2020, has created provisions for Rs. 3000 crores for AI skills development, digitalization of 100,000 Gram Panchayat through the Bharatnet initiative, setting up data center parks across the country and so on.

        AI & ML impact us and our society in many ways, including social, economic, legal, political, and regulatory impacts. AI-integrated solutions have occupied many daily activities, and AI push is already seen in industrial growth rates. Many countries have started publicizing their National-level AI strategies, including the Indian AI stack by NITI Aayog. Indian AI stack has proposed to adopt a three-pronged approach, which includes creating proof-of-concept of AI projects in various areas, building an AI-based start-up ecosystem in India, and Collaborating with experts and stakeholders.

        The first batch of Batchelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine learning(ML) at RV College of Engineering started in 2021 with an intake of 60. The curriculum of the AI&ML program is designed to provide necessary basics in Computer science engineering with specialized knowledge and skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement learning, NLP, HCI, Data Science, Meta Heuristics, Computer Vision, Business Intelligence, and other interdisciplinary areas.

        Department comprised of faculty members with long academic experience in the domain and pursuing research activities in all related disciplines of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning.

      <h2>Mechanical Department</h2>
      <p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering, established in 1985, is one of the pioneering departments of SRM IST. The present faculty strength is 118 off which 62  are with PhD and the rest are on the verge of completion. More than 1200+ research papers have been published in leading international journals with high impact factor and more than 1000 papers have been presented in international conferences.

        The department is functionally divided into three broad areas of specialization: (i) Design (ii) Manufacturing and (iii) Thermal. The department also offers Doctoral programs in these three areas of specializations. The National Board of Accreditation has accredited the Mechanical Engineering programme for six years from the year 2021 to 2027. The B.Tech. – Mechanical Engineering program at Kattankulathur campus is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org.
        
        The department offers Semester Abroad Program for our UG students in which they will begiven the opportunity of a lifetime to spend a semester at some of the best universities in the world such as – Carnegie Mellon, Northeastern University, SUNNY Buffalo, University of Wisconsin, UC Berkeley, George Mason, New Hampshire, Lille Catholic University, University of Western Australia, Western Ontario, Queen’s University and many others.</p>
